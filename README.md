# Interactive Comments Section

**Aim:** To practice building a fully interactive comment system with CRUD functionality and persistent state.

**Overview:** A responsive comments section allowing users to add, reply, edit, delete, and vote on comments. All interactions are saved locally, demonstrating full CRUD behavior without a backend.

**Skills Strengthened:** DOM Manipulation | Event Handling | State Management | Local Storage Persistence | Responsive Design | Modular JavaScript

**Challenges & Solutions:**  
- *Challenge:* Preventing event stacking and maintaining consistent state across dynamic elements → *Solution:* Implemented careful event delegation and state syncing strategies.  
- *Challenge:* Persisting user interactions across page reloads → *Solution:* Used `localStorage` to save and load comment data efficiently.  
- *Challenge:* Handling UI responsiveness and modal interactions → *Solution:* Modularized components and applied CSS best practices for dynamic layouts and modals.

**Key Takeaways:** Learned to manage complex interactive UIs, maintain consistent state across dynamic elements, and implement persistent CRUD functionality without a backend.
